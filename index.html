Sipping on Rosé, Silver Lake sun, coming up all lazy. I can see the writing on the wall. Pop your Pérignon. The girl's a freak, she drive a jeep in Laguna Beach. What you're waiting for, it's time for you to show it off. That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor. I know you like it sweet. From Tokyo to Mexico, to Rio. Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin.</p>

           <p class="content-p">You brought me to life, now every February you'll be my Valentine, Valentine. You brought me to life, now every February you'll be my Valentine, Valentine. Oh oh! Last Friday night. Trying to connect the dots, don't know what to tell my boss. Takes you miles high, so high, 'cause she’s got that one international smile. This is pure paradise, even heaven is jealous of our love. You're so supersonic, wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers. Sometimes when I miss you I put those records on. You hear my voice, you hear that sound. It’s in the palm of your hand now baby. Heaven is jealous of our love, angels are crying from up above.</p>
